This pop filter is the answer. But why do you need a pop filter you ask? Two words, “aspirated plosives”. when speaking, or singing, certain letters and sounds (such as “P” and “B”) can create a burst of air which can lead to clipping in your recordings. The dual nylon layers in this filter work by trapping and dispersing the air caused by these letters, preventing the bursts from reaching your microphone. Additional benefits include reducing errant breath noise and removing “lisping” from some “S” sounds. The screen also protects your microphone from saliva and moisture. This magical screen is connected to a super flexible, but strong, 13” metal gooseneck.

The Radial BigShot ABY is a compact ABY switcher that enables you to switch between two amplifiers or combine the signal when you want both amps to play at the same time. This true-bypass ABY switcher is completely passive meaning that there are no tone altering buffers between the guitar and the amplifier. With the BigShot ABY, you get the pure tone from your guitar plugged direct into your amp. To add versatility, the BigShot ABY is also equipped with a separate tuner out. This 'always on' output feeds your tuner for constant monitoring while keeping it out of the signal chain. Should you experience hum and buzz problems due to ground loops, the BigShot ABY comes to the rescue with a built-in isolation transformer and ground lift switch. Once engaged, you can toggle the polarity of the second amplifier to ensure both amps play in absolute phase. In use, the BigShot ABY is simple to use and efficient on stage. When powered by an external 9V supply or pedalboard power brick, full size super-bright LEDs spring to life to provide instant on-stage amplifier status readout. When power is unavailable, the passive audio signal path still works, unaffected. The compact yet ultra-rugged design makes the BigShot ABY ideal for pedalboards where space is always at a premium.""]",129.99,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31rfOK58TaL._AC_.jpg,"[{'title': 'EX Guitar Effects Loop Switcher Pedal ', 'url': 'https://www.amazon.com/vdp/078a9a8fc1f8439ab47dbc5184717ad2?ref=dp_vse_rvc_0', 'user_id': ''}, {'title': 'Sonicake Aby Pedal', 'url': 'https://www.amazon.com/vdp/045501cce34e4717b05d9882b89e0227?ref=dp_vse_rvc_1', 'user_id': ''}, {'title': 'Orange Amp Detonator Buffered ABY Switcher Pedal', 'url': 'https://www.amazon.com/vdp/a567df2fe37249f6847c589c942abc81?ref=dp_vse_rvc_2', 'user_id': ''}]",Radial Engineering,"['Musical Instruments', 'Instrument Accessories', 'Guitar & Bass Accessories']","{'Item Weight': '1.4 Pounds', 'Product Dimensions': '6.4 x 4.1 x 3 inches', 'Item model number': 'BigShot ABY', 'Best Sellers Rank': {'Musical Instruments': 38630, 'Guitar & Bass Accessories': 10745}, 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Date First Available': 'April 13, 2004', 'Color Name': 'MultiColored', 'Signal Format': 'Analog', 'Voltage': '240 Volts', 'Brand': 'Radial Engineering', 'Style': 'Compact', 'Color': 'MultiColored', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '6.4 x 4.1 x 3 inches'}",

You get six of Mackie's Vita preamps for your mic, guitar, keyboard, or anything else you need for your show. After you've plugged in, tap into the powerful ReadyFX effects engine to add excitement to your mix. Show your audience you care by giving them the best sound you can with the Mackie ProFX12v2 USB mixer. Like the name says, the ProFX12v2 is a professional mixer, with convenient features and sound that rival some larger format mixers. Mackie designed the Vita preamps with live sound in mind to provide the quality of sound that is lacking in some compact mixers. Each channel features its own individual 3-band EQ and 100Hz low-cut filter for shaping the sound of your inputs. The ReadyFX digital effects engine gives you access to 16 different effects including reverbs and delays - Mackie even added chorus effects for your guitar. A 7-band graphic EQ can be assigned either to your main outputs so you can fine tune the PA, or to the aux output to easily get rid of feedback in your monitors. If you perform with backing tracks, there are inputs (including USB) for your laptop or MP3 player, a headphone output with individual level control, and even phantom power for your condenser mics. With the added convenience of a hi-Z input for direct instrument input, you have no reason NOT to own a ProFX12v2. The ProFX12v2 is exactly what you need for mixing when the gig calls for minimal inputs, but that's not where its usefulness ends.

F-ONE is formulated using a complex mixture of the finest ultra refined tree and seed oils to clean, condition & protect your fretboard/fingerboard. 100% free of any lemon oil extracts, waxes, petroleum distillates, silicone, and water. We chose not to use any lemon oil because it contains d-limonene, which is a strong solvent that is used to remove paint and glue. In addition, we believe the high acidity levels of lemon oil can dry out the fretboard over time and require more frequent fretboard care. F-ONE leaves your fretboard looking new, playing great and feeling smooth, never sticky or tacky. Our revolutionary formula penetrates & conditions the wood to dry fast and give it a new look for months.

When I cranked the volume to 90 % the clarity was just un-believable. The power amp built into this mixer is 225 x 2 RMS @ 8 ohms and 300 x 2 RMS @ 4 ohms. We rate the RMS very strictly the way famous brands like Mackie rate their items.

Embracing this philosophy of transparent sound, these mixing consoles deliver a level of sonic purity and sound quality that is unmatched in their class. This is where it all starts. Everything you do as a sound engineer is dependent on the quality of your preamps, which determines the direction your mix will take, and ultimately how good it is going to sound. MG Series mixing consoles feature Yamaha\'s studio-grade discrete class-A D-PRE preamps, which utilize an inverted Darlington circuit comprising two cascading transistors in a configuration that provides more power with lower impedance. Delivering fat, natural sounding bass and smooth, soaring highs, with very low distortion, D-PRE preamps possess an impressively wide frequency range that allow them to handle signal from any audio source without overly amplifying any specific elements of the sound. Having such a pure sonic platform to build on will ultimately save you time and effort by eliminating the need for excessive EQing or additional effects processing in order to ""fix"" your mix.']",204.99,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51vO5bY+yJL._AC_.jpg,"[{'title': 'The best mixer for Musicians, Podcasts, Livestreams and more', 'url': 'https://www.amazon.com/vdp/084b95c3f8364eec9807ec7fe3f38505?ref=dp_vse_rvc_0', 'user_id': '/shop/dannyblack'}, {'title': 'Perfect mixer with USB interface and Effects', 'url': 'https://www.amazon.com/vdp/0d838e900c90443694cb838e60da0835?ref=dp_vse_rvc_1', 'user_id': '/shop/dannyblack'}, {'title': ""HONEST REVIEW - I've used this for over 100 GIGS!!"", 'url': 'https://www.amazon.com/vdp/0cb9861ef09c4a0282fcee0726287150?ref=dp_vse_rvc_2', 'user_id': '/shop/zoeymariephoto'}, {'title': 'Yamaha MG16XU mixer review', 'url': 'https://www.amazon.com/vdp/017cb5976f02452f8d48f40dc893c1bf?ref=dp_vse_rvc_3', 'user_id': '/shop/tsakhimtv'}, {'title': 'Helpful Tips Before You Buy a YAMAHA MG10XU Stereo Mixer', 'url': 'https://www.amazon.com/vdp/057040625f004ab9a8a3d8d86c2b8207?ref=dp_vse_rvc_4', 'user_id': '/shop/cryptofuture'}, {'title': 'Pyle PMXU43BT Overview, Review and Sound Test of FX', 'url': 'https://www.amazon.com/vdp/0aa1b69f5dec4e9193f763b10d2f656c?ref=dp_vse_rvc_5', 'user_id': '/shop/expertisland'}, {'title': 'Yamaha MG10XU 10 input Mixer with EFX ! - My Live Rig !

You\'ll notice most imported wire and cable manufacturers will rate their wire in ""G"" or Gauge (not AWG). The ""G"" rating can be used for any wire size. For example: A 12G rated cable may only be equivalent to a 18AWG cable (or worse). There are no regulations or specifications on ""G"" rated cables.

(Dual Integrated Arc) design gives you greater cutting control, perfect fret centerlines and a finer fret finish. It’s sharp enough to quickly bring the sides of the fret up to a clearly defined center, without worrying about accidentally taking too much off the top. Some of our customers have even called it foolproof.', 'Prevent Damage to Your Frets and Fretboard - with the Dagger’s exclusive smooth beveled, contoured edges. The angled cutting surfaces and ergonomic handle are balanced and comfortable, helping to reduce hand fatigue, and also preventing damage to your guitar body by allowing maximum file and finger clearance over the guitar body, switches and pots as you move up your guitar neck. In most cases there’s no need to mask off your fingerboard.', 'Avoid School Bus Roof Shaped Frets and Their Tone Destroying Effects - Precisely leveled and crowned frets are the very foundation of a great sounding guitar. Worn, grooved, flattened frets will rob you of tone, volume, while doing a number on intonation. Our professional grade crowning file was created with file masters in the heart of Europe to fix these issues. Made from high carbon European tool steel with razor-sharp teeth to deliver a clean, ready-to-be-polished cut every time.', 'Designed For Most Guitars - This dual-sided fret crowning file is the ideal size and shape for acoustic and vintage electric guitars (MD or LG side), as well as modern electric guitars, or those with jumbo and super jumbo frets (LG or XL side), up to about 110”-112” wide maximum (aka Dunlop 6100). For huge monster frets, we have a “Mega” version of the Dagger 2.0 file coming soon. Use with FretGuru’s Precision Fret Leveling Beam for best performance.', 'For Professional Luthiers, Guitar Techs, Hobbyists and Beginners - The Dagger file is precise, advanced and durable enough to satisfy the most demanding professional luthier, yet so comfortable, easy and intuitive to use that even a first-time beginner can get superb results. Regular fret crowning, repair, maintenance and polishing has never been more comfortable, fast and easy']","['We’ve completely re-engineered the original, highest rated, best selling FretGuru file, resulting in an unbelievable performance improvement.', 'At the heart of the new file is FretGuru’s exclusive D.I.A.

Ideally you want to leave the finest sliver of leveled fret along the centerline, which is then polished.', 'Diamond files are often guilty of this - with the random way diamond grains are applied to the cutting groove, the stray grains often stick up higher than the surrounding grit.', ""How did we do it?

Since about mid-2013, this capo has a new, even more ergonomic design and instead of the rubber cap, a roller as on the S-Series, which transfers the pressure even more sensitively to the back of the neck. The C1 is suitable for acoustic guitars and most electric guitars with a slightly arched fingerboard. Gold plating has long been a luxurious finish for musical instruments and accessories. While gold is undeniably beautiful, it is not at all durable; it will wear off far too easily and quickly. And it is famously expensive. But now Shubb have researched a high-tech finishing technique that utilizes titanium to produce a capo that has all the beauty of real gold, but is as durable as any metal finish you will ever find.

To meet the demands of the players and their increasingly 'hot-rodded' amplifiers, we set out to develop a modern speaker, capable of handling much more power and overdrive. To achieve this, we coupled our 'H' magnet (the closest in performance to Alnico) with a new cone and voice coil employing contemporary materials. Our most revealing speaker, the Vintage 30 features enormously detailed and complex overtones, a warm low-end, a famously rich vocal mid-range and a beautifully detailed top-end. Used singly to reveal the complexities in hand-wired boutique amps, or in quartets for a wonderfully intricate vintage three dimensional crunch, the Vintage 30 sound has been captured on thousands of recordings by players including Slash and Peter Frampton and bands ranging from Gov't Mule to Killswitch Engage.

It's with this in mind that Wampler combined Brad's two favorite Wampler tones in the Paisley Deluxe dual overdrive pedal. By cramming a Paisley Drive and Brian's Underdog circuits into a single pedal, Wampler is delivering the ultimate Brad Paisley pedal. Not only do you have independent access to both tones, but you are able to stack them for more harmonically rich drive in any order you want. And taking a cue from Wampler's popular Tom Quayle signature Dual Fusion's groundbreaking signal routing, you're able to run each side of the Paisley Deluxe as an individual pedal, perfect for today's pedal switcher-based rigs.

Sold as a pair, the C02 microphones are ideal in applications requiring multiple mic placements, including percussion instruments such as cymbals and overheads as well as string instruments like guitar and violin. Using multiple mics help ensure accurately captured audio with increased detail for your recordings. The C02 features a low-mass capsule with a cardioid polar pattern. A cardioid pattern captures a narrow pick up area right in front of the microphone, with a result that minimizes ambient room noise and signal from nearby instruments and monitors that may cause feedback. A wide, linear frequency response results in rich detail while minimizing low frequency noise. The Samson C02 Condenser Microphone is a great solution for both live sound and studio recording applications. Rugged brass case ensures reliable performance in even the most demanding environments. View larger Includes Carrying Case The C02 package comes with a convenient carrying case as well as a set of shock-mounted mic clips, making it easy to transport and set up your condenser mics.

It uses three ECC83/12AX7 preamplification tubes and two EL84 power tubes for the amplifier section, plus a Celestion Red Truvox 1215 speaker. The EL84 tube is the tube that powered the Mullard amplifiers favored by the British Invasion bands of the 1960s. It can produce a full output from a relatively small signal and is therefore easily overdriven to produce that distinctive chiming, treble-heavy sound, especially when compared to the 6L6 tubes more commonly used in 1960s era American guitar amps. The amplifier handles frequencies between 80Hz and 10kHz, with hum and noise -75dB below the rated power and 0.5% total harmonic distortion. It includes a Low input and a High input, with the former attenuating the signal by approximately 50% and the latter being easier to overdrive. The cabinet is ported in the rear and features a leather handle, cloth speaker grill, and a cream-colored, textured, synthetic leather exterior with chrome corner guards. The amp features a genuine spring reverb with the ability to enable it remotely using a foot switch.

Introducing the world's first Variable Instrument Performance amplifier, the VYPYR V.I.P. The world's first amp that contains Bass guitar, Acoustic guitar and Electric guitar amplifier models. Now for the first time ever using our Variable Instrument Input a single amp can provide amplification for a variety of instrument types. Not only does the amplifier morph from a bass amp to an acoustic amp, to an electric amp. It also, for the first time ever in an amplifier in this category, allows the electric guitar player access to instrument models as well. Using appropriate technology, Peavey uses a combination of powerful 32-bit, floating point SHARC processors and patented Transtube analog circuitry to create the best sounding modeling amplifiers available. Nothing sounds as good as a VYPYR. All VYPYR effects, amp models and parameter controls can be accessed via the amp itself, with no need to hook the amplifier to a computer. Peavey's WYSIWYG control surface quickly allows the user the ability to see and adjust the control position, no guessing where the control is supposed to be, or having to manually move it to where it should be preset to preset. VYPYRs new USB bi-directional data and audio port provides and easy way to record, and or connect to our VYPYR software and store presets, get lessons, and practice to backing tracks while connected to your computer. All of the revolutionary features from the original VYPYR series now even better.

No battery, no onboard electronics, just the pure pickups. Don\'t be fooled by the sound of some competitors\' ""thin sounding"" passive systems. The Pure Systems are definitely different. They sound full and rich and have sufficient output to drive most amps and PA systems directly, without a preamp! Advantages of the Pure Guitar System The special Pure surface transducers transmit a significant portion of the soundboard because they are not as close to the strings as an under-saddle pickup. Each of the 3 transducers is designed to pick up a specific string pair, but also ""listens"" to the adjacent area around the bridge. The Pure pickups are not under pressure and therefore do NOT sound percussive or harsh. The Pure System reproduces all strings nicely balanced, a known problem with under-saddle pickups. The Pure System sounds great just in passive mode! Unlike under-saddle pickups which passively can sound thin and trebley, the passive PURE system puts out a nicely balanced, warm, full range signal. Feedback Resistance How safe is the Pure System with feedback? Due to the Pure System\'s location on the bridge plate under the bridge, feedback resistance is comparable to under-saddle transducers. Technically, a pickup installed in or on the bridge is a lot less likely to feedback than one which is attached to the open sound board. The 1/8"" thin sound board can act like a diaphragm and vibrate along with loud sound-signals from speaker cabinets. This is the kind of feedback you experience on an acoustic guitar. The thicker bridge area is a lot harder to be set into vibration from an outside source simply because of its mass.

We chose not to use any lemon oil because it contains d-limonene, which is a strong solvent that is used to remove paint and glue. In addition, we believe the high acidity levels of lemon oil can dry out the fretboard over time and require more frequent fretboard care.

Whether on stage or in the studio, the P1 provides performers and recording artists with a dependable and affordable personal monitoring solution. Drummer-Proof Output The P1' high-power headphone output ensures that as the band gets louder, you'll still be able to hear every nuance of your performance. And the P1' simple user interface makes it easy for everyone to dial in a perfect mix every time. Using the P1 also helps protect your hearing in two ways. First, thanks to a built-in current limiter, unexpected peaks in signal level won't get to your ears. Second, the simple act of wearing headphones or earbuds helps isolate your ears from loud stage volume of instrument amps and monitor wedges. With the P1, you can clearly hear your own performance and blend in the ideal amount of the rest of the band. The Perfect Monitor Mix Dual XLR inputs allow 2-channel, mono or stereo operation with a convenient mix function which allows you to run two sources into the P1 and dial-in exactly what you want to hear as you perform. Two simple controls, Level and Balance, help you achieve the perfect mix in an instant. The P1 lets you take control of what you hear and allows the engineer to concentrate on providing the audience the best listening experience. Plus, setup is so fast and easy, letting you concentrate on putting on the best performance when you hit the stage.

This 6-inch cable has right angle plugs so you can place your pedals very close together without unnecessary lengths of cable lying on the floor. This works to clean up your rig and eliminate unwanted noise. Hosa\'s injection-molded cable terminations, for which they have become famous. Recording studios, stage racks, keyboards and effects devices all can be connected with molded assemblies like their CPP-, CPR-, and CRA-series cables and snakes which perform just as well as much more expensive cables with metal-headshell assemblies. Hosa began business in 1984 with the belief that less-expensive doesn\'t have to mean ""cheaper"", and that it simply isn\'t necessary to connect your equipment with ""NASA-approved"", gold-plated cables thick enough to tow an eighteen-wheeler. So, if you can\'t afford to spend a week\'s equipment allowance for a few cables then look no further than the Hosa brand for professional cables that work as hard as you do. In the regular Hosa line, they pay strict attention to the basics of cable design and construction. They make sure that their cables are well-shielded from external sources of radio-frequency and current-induced noise and that they\'re of the proper gauge and of high copper purity to ensure low capacitance. In addition, Hosa uses correct soldering techniques to eliminate ""cold-solder"" joints which could cause intermittent connections or ""ground hums"". And finally they make sure that the jacket and head-shell/strain-relief combination are rugged enough to withstand the rigors of the intended application.

Maybe your guitar gets lost in the mix? Do you have major feedback issues with your acoustic? The problem\'s not your guitar-you need an equalizer! You can instantly improve the sound of your guitar with a little help from the EQ700.Most performers don\'t have a clue about what good equalization can do for their sound. Maybe you\'ve heard the old maxim, ""Make a sine-wave to get really good sound,"" or ""Make a smiley-face, that always works."" Sadly, this qualifies as advice from the uninformed. Just as every room is unique, so is every musical instrument. Even guitars made by the same manufacturer, using the same materials, on the same day can vary a great deal.People provide a good example of this principal-although we are all similar, we don\'t all wear the same size shoes, or even have the same color eyes. There is no one ""perfect"" equalization curve that fits every scenario; equalization is dynamic.Most acoustic and electric guitar energy lies between 100 Hz and 6.4 kHz. Even slight changes in this range can cause a tremendous variation in overall energy and impact, as the human ear is especially sensitive to this range.Boosting frequencies around 200 Hz - 400 Hz often provides warmth and body, while boosting frequencies in the 3.2 kHz - 6.4 kHz range adds clarity to clean guitar signals. Depending on the amount of distortion, this same range can ruin the sound of an overdriven electric guitar by adding harsh harmonics.One of the most common mistakes is adding too much bass to acoustic guitars. If the low frequencies are boosted excessively, acoustics can easily get lost in the overall mix. Most acoustic guitars are also prone to feedback in the 200 Hz - 400 Hz range.A general rule of thumb-the best results are often achieved by finding and reducing the frequency bands that are offending, and then turning up the overall volume, rather than boosting on']",29.0,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51NS5Vsrh-L._AC_.jpg,[],Behringer,"['Musical Instruments', 'Amplifiers & Effects', 'Guitar Effects', 'Electric Guitar Effects', 'Equalization']","{'Item Weight': '0.73 Pounds', 'Product Dimensions': '2.76 x 2.13 x 4.84 inches', 'Domestic Shipping': 'Currently, item can be shipped only within the U.S. and to APO/FPO addresses.
